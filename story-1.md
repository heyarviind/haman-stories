I have heard of various incidents about partition. Different houses, people parting from their families, getting lost, some found back and others either dead or living a compromising life. Women being the softest target became a source of manly satisfaction of hurting opposite nationality. Mass rapes of girls,  women taken, their naked and burnt bodies laid down on roads decaying and throwing humanity into the Valley of shame. Different stories revolved everywhere, stories about some being saved miraculously. Such stories accelerated the desire and hope for better conditions but what I kept seeing in front of my eyes did otherwise.

 Today after ten years post division, the only thing I am left with is observation, observation of lives of people. Since childhood, I have always been an ignorant when it came to people and their feelings. My mind always had an urge to understand people, I have always tried to interpret their faces and decode their mind by judging the situations. I know that my deductions could prove as irrelevant and exaggerated sometimes, but I’m incapable of controlling my mind. My family and six other families traveled from east Lahore (now Pakistan) to Hindustan. Even a respected Hindu community couldn’t live in their own houses and earned lands. Both the countries turned red with deaths just due to signing on a single piece of paper.



We are the migrants and live in Delhi. Delhi, a city that gave shelter to lots of people like us. I live here with my family, my parents, brother Madhav, sister Geeta and fellow refugees. My sister Geeta got married to a sweet shop owner in west Delhi two years ago. Refugees, a term attached as a label to our identity now and it seems like it will get a fixed recognition in future.



 Today I am going to a house of five, a messed up family, a family that has suffered a similar fate like us. They were our neighbors back then and still are. Their elder daughter Shiva is getting engaged today. Shiva is rather a quiet girl. She also has an elder sister who is more beautiful than she is, a reason for continuous second choice for society. She always seems haunted by her assumption of being lesser than her elder. Always shy, serene and obedient, she was the favorite child of her father.

‘Happiness looks good on you', 

‘You look really pretty',

‘Your skin looks beautiful and soft',

Everyone was gathering around her which made her feel very special. Her face reflected the glow of happiness she was receiving.  Orange, pink and red color painted the scenery of engagement. It seemed as if a movie scene of traditional house weddings had just popped in front me. Huge hurricane of relatives chattering about life and its conditions,  friends playing the teasing game with bride and fighting for who will be the next one getting engaged, little kids playing and prancing all over the scene, beautiful music playing in background, older women singing the songs of happiness and prosperity for bride and the groom.

Even for me, it was all new and magical. After partition, this was the first celebrated event in any house in our area. It was like everyone gathered not just to bless Shiva but also to cherish this missing happiness after a long time. In these past years, marriages were low-key events. People had lost their reasons for happiness. This wedding was the missing happiness in women's lives. Girls who got married in last few years were trying to find missing satisfaction of being welcomed into a new home through this wedding. They were trying to feel every little custom with their heart as if they were getting married again.

Shiva and her family had occupied this house after being shoved away from their older house just like us. She was sitting like a mannequin on the cot covered with an expensive hand-woven sheet of red wool. The way she looked at the ongoing merrymaking displayed her doubt about two things, her excitement and doubt about getting married. Her face held a question mark on her forehead in the form of worry lines. These lines are born either by the nervousness of getting married or due to upcoming uncertainty being added to her life.

‘Is she pure and static?’ was a comment I heard as I passed the group of four women sitting along with Shiva's sister.

Shiva's sister got married six years ago to a landlord’s son. Her marriage was a low-key affair due to unrest in country, life, and brains of people after riots. She went off with blessings of her father and three more relatives. Her mother was a caught up in riots. Burnt and hurt, she lied painfully in bed for her leftover life. Finally, after years of suffering, she died ten days before her daughter’s marriage. The broken joint of leg and back, her broken sitting stance was a clear evidence of the animal that lives in every human. The only trigger required to unleash this animal is the correct amount of anger and greed of unhealthy superiority.  She was alive for three long years in that agony. There is no more pain than getting married in the shadow of the death of your loved ones.

I was eight years old when our country got divided into two. There was nothing secret in what happened during those times with women. Girls who were teenagers, young and old raped on a mass level. I doubt kids if anyone spared kids, but at least this was not something that I had seen. Those who crossed the path of this unfortunate fate either killed themselves or murdered by people. Those who survived were leading a life of sewer pig.

Today after years, hearing a question on purity recollected my mind that nothing had changed for women. In all these years this probe was normal for women who had migrated from either side. They were still doubted on their hymen or virginity status by everyone and every point of their life. Those who got married in those times never received the honor and respect they deserved, regardless of whatever their physical condition was. 

A question always arose in my mind that why always its a woman who has to prove herself on every level of living. Since birth, working in the kitchen and living in the cape of ‘you will need this in your next house’, serving everyone in the family and adjusting your likes and dislikes according to them, then getting married and doing the same for next family. It seems like the compromises required for a life is always expected out of a woman alone. What happened during those times was an unfortunate outcome of a political decision. Now the culprits are living a normal life and victims are suffering from a terrible fate of life with a permanent questionable character certificate.

Today Shiva was going to see her future husband for the first time. She was ten years elder to me, so I always had a juvenile practice of chatting with her. I sat next to her. She was happy seeing me and gave me a soft hug.

‘ Where is Geeta?’ she asked me.

Geeta was her best friend. Whenever she came from her house she would spend most of the time with Shiva. Both of them talked non-stop for hours. I was small, so I used to hide in various places where no one could see me. My curiosity to know things made me vulnerable to eavesdropping even as a kid. Once or twice I heard about what they talked when they thought no one was around. Geeta used to tell her about her husband, family, gossiping about in-laws, and a lot of other things which she could never share with our parents. Dependence on husband and family for money and stuff, emotional in satisfaction from relations, no freedom of own life, just working and feeding family. These psychological problems are some of them which cannot be discussed with the family. When it comes to girls these problems become complaints, ones which she should learn to live with staying in her marriage. A girl is always expected to get these complaints from her mind and stay cheerful always, like a plastered mannequin with a smile. 

There is no greater misfortune in having a complete and full family for you, but still having to depend on an outsider to confide your feelings. Shiva had a complete family with a  father, elder sister and a brother yet she tried to find her real family in the face of Geeta. Mt sister was the only one she used to open up with about her health, mind, and soul. She keeps trying to find her lost relationship with her father in her friendship. Maybe that’s what friends are for, whatever emotion we are missing in our life, we try to fulfill and re-live it through them.

‘She is in the courtyard. Do you want something?’ I asked her.

‘ No, just tell her to stay near  me.’ She smiled and answered back.

I was about to get up when suddenly I heard two women shouting.

‘The groom has arrived’  a woman shouted. I got distracted from my thoughts and followed the scene with my sight. Everyone became impatient and started to panic.

‘Reach the main entrance to receive them’ a relative spoke.

‘Get the garland, be fast girls’

All the required stuff reached the door and various ceremonies took place.  After that, everyone got caught up in the fiasco of arriving guests. People running here and there as if nothing was pre-prepared. I think it's just a habit of Asians to panic at last moments. They behave as if everything they were working on was wrong and when the guest is at their front door, they suddenly feel the need to change everything.

Everyone from the groom side entered the courtyard and started settling. They were three dozen of people who were behaving as if they were from the family of the great Akbar. The way the met and greeted others made their mentality of being superior completely transparent. Younger was just the same as elders, their spines resembled like an iron rod as if their backbones attached to some iron rod hence unable to bend.

I was eager to see the groom, so I went behind the chandelier that was just outside the room. Our room opened exactly into the courtyard. Being careful that no one sees me, I went behind it and peeked towards the boy. He was a tall man of thirties, brown, rough and unusually stone-faced. He looked older and serious than his age. His expressions were cold and the vibes I felt seeing him were negative and rather disturbing, maybe I was being cynical but there was something about him that worried me. His face contradicted a basic engagement day face expression. 

 Without wasting time everyone started ceremony outside. I rushed inside to help her. 

‘ Cover her face first ’ said a woman from behind. And so her dupatta covered her entire face. Even her neck was not visible.

I always think about such beliefs of people. Being a girl, it is mandatory for you to stay out of sight of the male gender. Even if you don't cover your face your behavior, the way you walk, talk, eat, dress and even the way you sleep cannot be eye-catching for a man. If you are a bride, let your face hidden from your husband, if you talk to him before marriage it is a bad omen and a black spot on your character for whole life. But getting married and having sex with the same person on the very first night is the presenter of your ethos and totally okay for everyone. These double standards are unacceptable for my mind. I have no idea how these postulates survived this long, and how long will they last?

We took her outside, I caught her from her left hand and helped her to sit on a chair. Throughout the ceremony, he didn't look at Shivieven once. His face suggested that he was not interested or consumed in anything that was going around. Everything went on smoothly and slowly it went from afternoon to dawn. All the men from the groom’s side started to settle back into their arranged transport. The engagement was over and I was standing in the courtyard and witnessing the unnecessary care that was being given to those people. I was turning my head from right to left direction when I noticed Shiva looking from the window of the room on the first floor. She was trying hard to camouflage herself behind Geeta, but I saw her clearly. She looked at her fiancé who will become her husband tomorrow. 

Her eagerness was completely visible through her eyes, and so was her worry. Her fiancé didn’t even look at her once, nor he showed any kind of enthusiasm towards the ceremony. Her impatient fingers were alimony of her shaking faith in her future. Her whole life had been a struggle, she was the second girl in-house and was less beautiful than her elder sister. Facing the hatred of society for being a girl, a non-loving father, an economic unsettlement and death of her mother. She had gone through a rough time and getting married was her only hope to get out and start a new one, but it seemed like her dream of a happy and respected life had already died in her heart. 

Why does life show this peak of cruelty only towards a woman? Teaching them to depend on people for their whole lives, carving them into caring dolls. Why are woman taught to stay calm and patient towards everything,  compromise, and self-domination? If a woman sees her life in a physical or mental threat,sheis always trained to cry for help either to her father, brother or husband. 

Shiva had seen her husband and his cold interest towards her. After hearing her conversation with Geeta it was clear that she was not sure about getting married to the man. But she had no choice, just like no other girl has ever had.

' Get her dress ready', the house worker got orders from another woman. Early morning next day, everyone is preparing for the wedding. As per the tradition in our culture, on the wedding day bride's bath ceremony takes place under women of house conducting some rituals and singing the songs of happy married. Then she wears her wedding attire. Everyone was getting ready for the wedding. The house looks good with flowers, sweets, and over excited relatives. I was eager to see the bride in her full beauty so I went inside her room.

And indeed, out of her whole life, a girl looks most beautiful on her wedding day.

She looked nothing less than a movie actress. Her perfect eyes, cherry lips, pink cheeks and her red attire was astonishingly unbelievable. The voice of bangles fighting with her dress, her joyous heaviness of her jewelry made her eye perfectly lined eyes even more adorable.

' A man has arrived from groom's party, looks like they are near somewhere. Everyone get ready fast! ', a woman shouted outside our room.

Whatever had happened on the engagement day, it looked like Shiva had managed to ignore it and had again started to fantasize about her husband and her new family. Listening to the announcement her cheeks started to turn red and she became uneasy sitting and standing both. Her change of expressions was hilarious, joyous and sight full. There was a great bustling going on outside in-house, in our room and in bride's mind. Geeta was adjusting her earrings when suddenly Shiva's father entered the room. He had tears in his eyes when he saw his daughter, but his eyes were indicating that the water flowing through them was not out of love but due to saturation of anger. He looked furiously towards his daughter. Everyone was quiet for a moment when he suddenly leaped forward and slapped her.

' She is never going to leave this house' were the words and he hit her again.

Greta hurried and caught Shiva and pulled her aside. A happy environment changed into a brutally painful one in seconds. The groom had backed out, and the reason he imposed was that he didn’t find the girl beautiful. Everything froze for some time, all the movement in the house, kids playing, women chattering is on a pause. It felt like time had stopped, nothing to say and nothing to do. After some time people came turn by turn, consolidated shivi and her father in a line or two and started heading back to their home. Within minutes whole house was empty and the only voice that could be heard was the girl sobbing in the corner of the room, the girl in a wedding dress.

Geeta immediately told me to go back home. I followed her instructions. It is very disturbing to see Shiva in the condition. No one is ever going to marry a woman who was ever engaged to a man and the man had denied to marry her. She will always stay bound to that ring for the rest of her life. In next few days, Geeta settled in at the abandoned bride’s house. On the fourth day she came back and told us that the boy had already got married to a girl, and he tied rituals exactly a day after he left this relation. It was like he already had a girl in mind.

A week later when Geeta came back, I heard her talking to my mother,

' She is unfortunate, and now she has to live her entire life bearing the heavy weight of that ring on her finger.’ 

It is going to take me my whole life to understand that if a boy rejects you, how are you unfortunate? We leave a lot of things in our life, reject them on the basis of our requirements, that doesn’t make them unwanted. We may not like that thing but there are other people interested in it. This doesn’t mean that the thing is unwanted, it’s just that I couldn’t accept it. It is never necessary that the article is defective, maybe my mind was corrupted or misjudgment lead to this decision.
